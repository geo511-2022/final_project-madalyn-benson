# Introduction

An algal bloom is the overgrowth of algae in water sources. Algal blooms occur when exposed to the correct environmental conditions (i.e. excess nutrients, warm temperatures, ample sunlight, and low-flow water conditions). A bloom can be short-lived (a couple of hours) or long-lived (a couple of weeks) depending on how long the algae persist in the environment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can be harmful to humans and the environment. When this occurs the algal species can produce toxins with serious health impacts to humans, degrade aquatic ecosystems, and also affect the economy near coastal areas. The dominant algae in New York State include but are not limited to: Green algae (Chlorophyta) Golden brown algae (Chrysophyta), which also includes a large group of diatoms Blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) Several smaller groups including (euglenoids, cryptomonads, and dinoflagellates)

The presence of the above harmful algal blooms varies both spatially and temporally in NYS, which results in varying risk for people, animals, and the local ecology. HABs are most prevalent in the months June through October, however they can occur at any time of year. HABs reduce tourism, close beaches, and greatly diminish local economies. Because of this unpredictability, harmful algal blooms are of national concern. Data suggests that certain environmental conditions can be used as a tool to better understand and predict HABs. This project aims to explore any trends between harmful algal blooms prevalence within New York State by relating HAB prevalence over time to environmental conditions and populations.

# Materials and methods

## Example 1

![Water Quality Assessment of New York State](https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/water_images/305basmtmap10.jpg)

Image 1 is the extracted raster data of the New York State water quality report from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).  I selected this image as an example because I will be needing a raster data image of New York for my project. This is a useful resource because it shows the water bodies in NYS. In my final project I will be showing where and when harmful algal blooms affect the water bodies of New York.

## Example 2 
![Climate Data Grapher](https://www.nyclimatescience.org/static/media/datagrapher.14b4fecf.png)

Image 2 is an interactive map of annual maximum temperatures in New York State from the New York Climate Change Science Clearinghouse (NYCCSC). This is a valuable data source because the user can select data from New York State stations from gridded observations, spatially aggregated by New York counties and river basins, or by states neighboring New York. Different time periods can be observed to see temperature changes over time.

## Example 3
![Freqeuncy of HAB Events](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kb-Padmakumar/publication/236142114/figure/fig4/AS:328425987428355@1455314265478/Frequency-of-occurrence-of-harmful-algal-blooms-during-the-last-century.png)

Image 3 is a figure displaying the occurrence of HAB events over time. This is a useful graphic because it is showing a sharp increase in algal blooms over 100 years. I would like to create a chart similar to this inorder to provide reasoning for an increase in algal blooms across NYS. I would do this by comparing other correlating data trends to support an increase in algal blooms.

# Proposed data sources
# Proposed methods
# Expected results

```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```

## Download and clean all required data

```{r}
n=20
data=data.frame(x=runif(n,-180,180),
                y=runif(n,-60,60),
                size = runif(n, 5, 20),
                category = factor(
                  sample(letters[1:5], n, replace = TRUE)
                  ),
                value = rnorm(n))
```

```{r, results='asis'}
data %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% #show only 1:n rows
  kable(digits=2,align="c")%>% #make table and round to two digits
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) #apply other formatting
```

Add any additional processing steps here.

# Results

[\~200 words]

Tables and figures (maps and other graphics) are carefully planned to convey the results of your analysis. Intense exploration and evidence of many trials and failures. The author looked at the data in many different ways before coming to the final presentation of the data.

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map of completely random data"}
m <- leaflet(data) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~x, ~y, radius = ~size,color = ~as.factor(category)) %>% 
  addPopups(~x[2], ~y[2], "Random popup")
m  # a map with the default OSM tile layer
```

```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,col=category))+
  geom_point()
```

# Conclusions
